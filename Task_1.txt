
You need to provide two way communication in a child parent relationship where one process will write a message and other will read it. Once the message is read that process should concatenate a acknowlegde message and send back to the process and that process will display it. 
Example Output:
Input: Hello I'm Process 1.
Process 2: Output:
Output: Message Received "Hello I'm Process 1." //Concatenation and send it to Process 1
Process 1: Output
Acknowlegded.
